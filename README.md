<h1>A website that allows you to build 3D objects using cubes. Made with React Three Fiber.

<p>
React three fiber transform controls. Click a box, controls to move it will pop up, then you can move the position of the box you selected. This updates the physics position of the box as well. There is a character that you can move around with WASD to interact with the boxes.
